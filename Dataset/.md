# ðŸ“š Healthcare Workforce Mental Health Dataset 


## :dart: Overview 
The Healthcare Workforce Mental Health Dataset provides structured data designed for exploring and visualizing workplace mental health trends in the healthcare industry. With 5,000 synthetic employee records, this dataset captures key workforce-related mental health factors, including stress levels, burnout frequency, job satisfaction, mental health absences, and turnover intention. This dataset is ideal for data analysts, students, and career changers looking to practice data exploration, workforce analytics, and interactive dashboard creation. It is fully compatible with a Power BI Dashboard Template, which provides pre-built 
visualizations for uncovering trends in burnout, stress factors, and turnover risks. 

## :bulb: Columns in the Dataset 
1. Employee ID â€“ Unique identifier for each employee (e.g., HCP-00001). 
2. Employee Type â€“ Role in the healthcare system (e.g., Registered Nurse, Physician, Medical Assistant). 
3. Department â€“ Department where the employee works (e.g., General Medicine, ICU, Pediatrics). 
4. Workplace Factor â€“ Primary workplace challenge affecting the employee (e.g., Heavy Workload, Poor Work Environment, Career Stagnation). 
5. Stress Level â€“ A 1-10 scale measuring workplace-related stress. 
6. Burnout Frequency â€“ Categorical variable indicating how often an employee experiences burnout: 
 * Never 
 * Occasionally 
 * Often 
7. Job Satisfaction â€“ 1-5 scale rating job satisfaction: 
 * 1 = Very Dissatisfied 
 * 5 = Very Satisfied 
8. Access to EAPs â€“ Whether the employee has access to Employee Assistance Programs (Yes/No). 
9. Mental Health Absences â€“ Number of mental health-related leave days taken. 
10. Turnover Intention â€“ Whether the employee is considering leaving their role (Yes/No).

## :scroll: Data Exploration & Visualization Focus 
This dataset is structured for insightful analysis and dashboard building. The relationships between variables provide opportunities to explore: 
  âœ” Burnout impact on job satisfaction <br>
  âœ” Stress level correlations with mental health absences <br> 
  âœ” Top workplace stressors by department <br>
  âœ” Turnover risks based on job satisfaction and burnout frequency <br>
  âœ” The effect of Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) on mental health absences <br>



## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Key Data Relationships & Trends 
These relationships between columns provide meaningful insights into workforce mental health: <br>
âœ” Employee Type â†’ Workplace Factor: Different roles experience unique stressors. <br>
Example: Registered Nurses report Heavy Workload, while Healthcare Administrators report Career Stagnation. <br>
âœ” Workplace Factor â†’ Stress Level: Certain stressors have a stronger impact on workplace stress. <br>
Example: Heavy Workload is associated with higher stress levels. <br>
âœ” Stress Level â†’ Burnout Frequency: Higher stress levels increase burnout occurrence. <br>
Employees with a stress level of 8-10 are more likely to experience frequent burnout. <br>
âœ” Burnout Frequency â†’ Job Satisfaction: Employees who frequently experience burnout report lower job satisfaction. <br>
Those in the "Often" burnout category tend to have job satisfaction scores of 1-2. <br>
âœ” Job Satisfaction + Stress Level â†’ Turnover Intention: Employees with low job satisfaction and high stress are more likely to consider leaving. <br> 
Example: Employees with Job Satisfaction â‰¤ 2 and Stress Level â‰¥ 7 are high turnover risks. <br>
âœ” Access to EAPs â†’ Mental Health Absences: Employees with access to Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) take fewer mental health absences.  <br>
Those without access to EAPs tend to have higher absence rates due to stress.
